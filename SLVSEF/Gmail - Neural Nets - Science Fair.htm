<font size="-1"><div dir="ltr">Hi Dustin,<div><br></div><div>I appreciate your willingness to help, so I'll get right into the nitty gritty details. Our science fair project involves implementing a neural network with gradient decent. More specifically, we are training our neural network using error backpropagation. Currently, we are running into a few issues regarding the implementation. I was wondering if you could possibly answer a few questions I had about the algorithm itself, and possibly some ideas you may have for impressive yet feasible datasets to which the network could be applied.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Concerning the algorithm, we have had a few successful runs implementing advance logic gates as well as recognizing primitive shapes. However, I am beginning to notice that the algorithm requires an extreme amount of fine tuning to converge for networks involving more than two output nodes. I'd be happy to send over our implementation (C#) if you'd like to look, but I'll try to explain roughly how I went about implementing it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>The implementation is pretty basic and could use some work. I am not at the moment using many principles of object oriented programming to accomplish the algorithm for the sake of getting it done; we are currently using an array based approach for online learning. Specifically, we have arrays for node-deltas, net weight-output sums, and the weights themselves. The implementation also makes use of bias nodes on every layer save for the output layer. Moreover, the project allows for multiple hidden layers and dynamic node counts for those specific layers. If it may be of any help, our backpropagation algorithm uses momentum as well as the hyperbolic tangent for the sigmoid activation function.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Although the algorithm is implemented as plainly as it is prescribed, I am still running into some unusual issues. For example, I find that in every example including basic xor logic gates, the learning rate of the network ends up being extremely small. This is quite perplexing due to the fact that most papers and example implementations I have seen have learning rates around 1.0f. Another strange issue that occurs sporadically is that when rerunning the network, the weights may sometimes never converge. I know that this is probably due to the fact that the weights are initialized randomly, but is there any heuristic method by which we can secure higher convergence rates? Finally, we seem to have a problem where sometimes weights become extremely negative so much so that the network then always outputs -1.0f without any chance of readjustment. Would it be worth reimplementing the whole algorithm under your guidance?</div>
<div><br></div><div>Regarding the science fair project, we were wondering if you had any ideas for interesting numerical or visual datasets (astronomical, medicine, cancer, or otherwise) for us to apply our neural networks to. Your assistance in this search is extremely optional however we'd be very appreciative if you could help us find an impressive dataset that neural networks could tackle.</div>
<div><br></div><div>We appreciate your assistance in all regards and will do our best to clearly convey our problems and questions to you in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance,</div><div><div><div dir="ltr">
